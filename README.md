# Library_Management_SQL

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Library Management System using SQL. The primary objective is to design and manage a relational database for a library, handling various operations such as book inventory management, member tracking, and issue/return records. This project showcases skills in database design, SQL querying, and efficient data management.

### Key Features
* **Comprehensive Database Design**: Includes a structured ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) that represents relationships between library entities such as books, members, employees, and branches.
* **CRUD Operations**: Supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on tables, allowing effective management of library data.
* **Advanced SQL Queries**: Implements complex queries to generate reports, track active members, and monitor book inventory and return quality.

## Features
**Book Management:** Add, update, and remove books from the library's collection. Track book details such as title, category, rental price, availability status, author, and publisher.
**Customer Management:** Maintain a record of library customers, including their names, addresses, registration dates, and issuance history.
**Employee Management:** Manage library staff, including employee names, positions, salaries, and branch assignments.
**Book Issuance and Returns:** Track the issuance and return of books by customers. Monitor the status of issued books and ensure timely returns.
**Branch Management:** Maintain information about library branches, including branch numbers, manager assignments, addresses, and contact details.

## Queries and Analysis
The project includes various SQL queries and data analysis tasks to extract valuable insights from the library's data. Some of the key queries implemented include:

1. Retrieve the book title, category, and rental price of all available books.
2. List the employee names and their respective salaries in descending order of salary.
3. Retrieve the book titles and the corresponding customers who have issued those books.
4. Display the total count of books in each category.
5. Retrieve the employee names and their positions for the employees whose salaries are above Rs.50,000.
6. List the customer names who registered before 2022-01-01 and have not issued any books yet.
7. Display the branch numbers and the total count of employees in each branch.
8. Display the names of customers who have issued books in the month of June 2023.
9. Retrieve book titles from the book table containing the category "history".
10. Retrieve the branch numbers along with the count of employees for branches having more than 5 employees.
