# Library_Management_SQL

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Library Management System using SQL. The primary objective is to design and manage a relational database for a library, handling various operations such as book inventory management, member tracking, and issue/return records. This project showcases skills in database design, SQL querying, and efficient data management.

### Key Features
* **Comprehensive Database Design**: Includes a structured ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) that represents relationships between library entities such as books, members, employees, and branches.
* **CRUD Operations**: Supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on tables, allowing effective management of library data.
* **Advanced SQL Queries**: Implements complex queries to generate reports, track active members, and monitor book inventory and return quality.

## Features
**Book Management:** Add, update, and remove books from the library's collection. Track book details such as title, category, rental price, availability status, author, and publisher.
**Customer Management:** Maintain a record of library customers, including their names, addresses, registration dates, and issuance history.
**Employee Management:** Manage library staff, including employee names, positions, salaries, and branch assignments.
**Book Issuance and Returns:** Track the issuance and return of books by customers. Monitor the status of issued books and ensure timely returns.
**Branch Management:** Maintain information about library branches, including branch numbers, manager assignments, addresses, and contact details.

## Queries and Analysis
The project includes various SQL queries and data analysis tasks to extract valuable insights from the library's data. Some of the key queries implemented include:

1. Retrieve All Books Issued by a Specific Employee.
2. List Members Who Have Issued More Than One Book.
3. Create Summary Tables.
4. Retrieve All Books in a Specific Category.
5. Find Total Rental Income by Category.
6. List Members Who Registered in the Last 180 Days.
7. List Employees with Their Branch Manager's Name and their branch details.
8. Create a Table of Books with Rental Price Above a Certain Threshold 7USD.
9. Retrieve the List of Books Not Yet Returned.
